# C-Final-Project

this is Assembler software, for assembly language Programmed in C.

This project is a significant part of the final grade in the "systems programming" course I conducted during 2021b.

This project is complex and requires over a month of work, so we were allowed to carry it out with the help of a partner.
I chose to build this project on my own.

This final project received a score of 100.

The requirements of the project were attached as a Word file.
